# Data-Structure-Lab
 This Repository is a Data structure lab all problems solve.

 A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer or memory system. It provides a way to store, access, and manipulate data efficiently. Data structures can be classified into two main types: primitive and non-primitive.

- Primitive data structures: Also known as primary data structures, these are predefined and built-in data structures provided by programming languages. Examples include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans. These data structures have a fixed size and are used to store individual pieces of data.

- Non-primitive data structures: These are more complex data structures built using primitive data types and other non-primitive data structures. They are designed to store a collection of related data. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. These data structures can have a dynamic size and provide more flexibility for storing and manipulating data.

The choice of data structure depends on the specific requirements of an application, such as the type of operations to be performed, the efficiency of accessing and updating data, and the amount of memory available. The selection of an appropriate data structure can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of an algorithm or program.
